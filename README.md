## CI/CD

This repository uses the [mojaloop/build](https://github.com/mojaloop/ci-config-orb-build) CircleCI orb for standardized CI/CD workflows, including automated Grype vulnerability scanning for source code security.

Mojaloop Event SDK provides a simple API to log different kind of messages ( trace, log, error, audit ) and publish them to a central logging infrastructure.

The API is defined by the `EventRecorder` interface and the `EventMessage` type.
This library provides the following recorder implementations by default:

| Recorder | Behaviour |
| - | - |
| `DefaultLoggerRecorder` | Logs events to console |
| `DefaultSidecarRecorder` | Logs events to [sidecar](https://github.com/mojaloop/event-sidecar) synchronously |
| `DefaultSidecarRecorderAsync` | Logs events to [sidecar](https://github.com/mojaloop/event-sidecar) asynchronously |

The logging behaviour can be modified as defined in the interfaces `EventPreProcessor` and `EventPostProcessor` which allow to use an `EventRecorder` that processes `EventMessage`s before sending them and its response, respectively.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @mojaloop/event-sdk
```

## Configuration

Edit the file in `./config/default.json` to configure the logger, or set the following Environment variables:

| Environment variable | Description | Default | Available Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EVENT_SDK_ASYNC_OVERRIDE_EVENTS` | A comma-separated list of events that should return immediately instead of waiting for the promises to resolve in the `recorder.record()` function. | `''` | Any combination of: `log,audit,trace` |
|`EVENT_SDK_LOG_FILTER` | Comma delimited List of `<eventType>`:`<eventAction>` key pairs that will be logged to the host console, as well as sent to the sidecar. Note `*:*` wildcard entry will print all logs, and if this field is empty ` ` then no logs will be printed. See [Current Supported Events](#current-supported-events) | `audit:*`, `log:info`, `log:error`, `log:warning` | `audit:*`, `log:info`, `log:error` |
|`EVENT_SDK_LOG_METADATA_ONLY` | This flag will only print the metadata portion of the event message, and exclude the content to minimise log verbosity. | `false` | `true`, `false` |
| `EVENT_SDK_SERVER_HOST` | The hostname for the gRPC server to bind to. | `localhost` | Any valid hostname |
| `EVENT_SDK_SERVER_PORT` | The port for the gRPC server to listen on. | `50055` | Any valid port value |
| `EVENT_SDK_SIDECAR_DISABLED` | Enables or disables the logging to event sidecar. | `true` | `true`, `false` |
| ~~`EVENT_SDK_SIDECAR_WITH_LOGGER`~~ | _DEPRECATED BY `EVENT_SDK_LOG_FILTER`_ - If true, the events will be logged to the host console, as well as sent to the sidecar. Only applicable if the event sidecar is enabled. | `false` | `true`, `false` |
| `EVENT_SDK_VENDOR_PREFIX` | Prefix for vendor specific tracestate handler. For more information refer [here](#tracestate-format-and-methods) | `acmevendor` | Any string |
| `EVENT_SDK_TRACESTATE_HEADER_ENABLED` | If enabled, the tracestate value is kept updated with every child and is inserted into the span tags. Otherwise, the tracestate is only updated if `injectContextToHttpRequest` is called and the `tracestate` is included into the request headers. | `false` | `true`, `false` |
| `EVENT_SDK_TRACEID_PER_VENDOR` | If enabled, when vendor of the parent span is different from the vendor set by `EVENT_SDK_VENDOR_PREFIX` the traceId will be new and the parent traceId will be stored as a tag: `corelationTraceId` . Otherwise, the traceId is persisted. | `false` | `true`, `false` |
| `EVENT_LOGGER_KAFKA` | When configured, events will be sent by default directly to Kafka. Should contain configuration for 3 Kafka producers in `PRODUCER.EVENT.LOG`, `PRODUCER.EVENT.TRACE` and `PRODUCER.EVENT.AUDIT` | `undefined` | `undefined`, `{PRODUCER:...}` |
| `EVENT_LOG`   | Controls processing of log events. When `undefined` the default processing is used.  | `undefined` | `undefined`, `sidecar`, `kafka`, `console`, `off` |
| `EVENT_TRACE` | Controls processing of trace events. When `undefined` the default processing is used.| `undefined` | `undefined`, `sidecar`, `kafka`, `console`, `off` |
| `EVENT_AUDIT` | Controls processing of audit events. When `undefined` the default processing is used.| `undefined` | `undefined`, `sidecar`, `kafka`, `console`, `off` |

## Tracestate format and methods

_Note: Tags in the tracestate are supported from version [v9.4.1](https://github.com/mojaloop/event-sdk/releases/tag/v9.4.1). Since [v9.5.2](https://github.com/mojaloop/event-sdk/releases/tag/v9.5.2) tracestate is base64 encoded string. To be able to use the tracestate correctly accross all services, they should have same version of event-sdk and [central-services-shared](https://github.com/mojaloop/central-services-shared) librarires._

### Format

Tracestate header can be used to preserve vendor specific information across various connected systems in multivendor setup. The  format is according to the [w3c specifications](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context/blob/master/spec/20-http_header_format.md#tracestate-header).
Tracestate header example value: `acmevendor=eyJzcGFuSWQiOiI2Njg2Nzk1MDBiMGUzYzQwIiwgInRyYW5zZmVyX3R4X21zOjE1OTA0MDc0NjUifQ==`, where the vendor is `acmevendor` and the value is base64 encoded key value pair as `spanId` key is set automatically. When decoded:  `{"spanId":"668679500b0e3c40", "transfer_tx_ms:1590407465"}`

### Methods to access the tracestate are:

* setTracestateTags - sets user tags into the tracestate
* getTracestates - Returns the tracestates object per vendor, as configured vendor tracestate is decoded key value pair with tags
* getTracestateTags - Returns the tracestate tags for the configured vendor as key value pairs

## Current Supported Events

| eventType | eventAction | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| audit | default | Default audit action. Used when no action has been specified |
| audit | start | Used to create start audit event |
| audit | ingress | Used to create ingress audit event |
| audit | egress | Used to create egress audit event |
| audit | finish | Used to create finish audit event |
| log | info | Info log level |
| log | debug | Debug log level |
| log | error | Error log level |
| log | verbose | Verbose log level |
| log | warning | Warning log level |
| log | performance | Performance log level |
| span | trace | Used to create trace event. These events sent with `span.finish()` method and are used for traceability |

## Usage

Instrumented services should be part of a configuration which includes the [event sidecar](https://github.com/mojaloop/event-sidecar) and [event-streaming-processor](https://github.com/mojaloop/event-streaming-processor). Detailed architecture overview can be found [here](https://docs.mojaloop.io/documentation/mojaloop-technical-overview/event-framework/)

Examples of usage of the SDK can be found in the `src/examples` directory of this repo: [Javascript example](src/examples/js_app.js) and [TypeScript example](src/examples/ts_app.ts).

## Auditing Dependencies

We use `audit-ci` along with `npm audit` to check dependencies for node vulnerabilities, and keep track of resolved dependencies with an `audit-ci.jsonc` file.

To start a new resolution process, run:

```bash
npm run audit:fix
```

You can then check to see if the CI will pass based on the current dependencies with:

```bash
npm run audit:check
```

The [audit-ci.jsonc](./audit-ci.jsonc) contains any audit-exceptions that cannot be fixed to ensure that CircleCI will build correctly.

## Automated Releases

As part of our CI/CD process, we use a combination of CircleCI, standard-version
npm package and github-release CircleCI orb to automatically trigger our releases
and image builds. This process essentially mimics a manual tag and release.

On a merge to main, CircleCI is configured to use the mojaloopci github account
to push the latest generated CHANGELOG and package version number.

Once those changes are pushed, CircleCI will pull the updated main, tag and
push a release triggering another subsequent build that also publishes a docker image.

### Potential problems

* There is a case where the merge to main workflow will resolve successfully, triggering
  a release. Then that tagged release workflow subsequently failing due to the image scan,
  audit check, vulnerability check or other "live" checks.

  This will leave main without an associated published build. Fixes that require
  a new merge will essentially cause a skip in version number or require a clean up
  of the main branch to the commit before the CHANGELOG and bump.

  This may be resolved by relying solely on the previous checks of the
  merge to main workflow to assume that our tagged release is of sound quality.
  We are still mulling over this solution since catching bugs/vulnerabilities/etc earlier
  is a boon.

* It is unknown if a race condition might occur with multiple merges with main in
  quick succession, but this is a suspected edge case.
